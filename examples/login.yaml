# Example configuration file for the bot client
# Copy this to db/login.yaml and edit it to your liking

# The address that the homeserver client api is reached on
# The safest setting will always to be the direct domain of dendrite, for pain.agency this would be https://matrix.pain.agency (delegation)
# for some reason it will bork if you try to input a localhost address. Perhaps it is attempting to make a SSL connection
homeserver-url: 'http://matrix.'

# Localhost port to run endpoints on
# Dendrite endpoints must be run from localhost.
# IIRC 8008 is the default/expected configuration for dendrite to be available on localhost

port: '8008'

# The login token for the bot to use
# This should be an admin account as the bot will use this to run Dendrite admin endpoints from
# it is recomended that the bot have its own account to prevent conflict
login-token: 'token'

# The room that administration commands can be run from
# Be careful with this room, any commands sent in that room will be accepted, regardless of PL
# It is recomended for security that this room only be federated with instances under the same adminstration,
# which will be an unfederated room 99% of the time.
# At this time the bot does not support encrypted rooms as it is expected for the room to remain only on the homeserver it administers.
# If there is no valid RoomID here, the bot wll create one, invite the 'authorized-users', and give them PL100

# Authorized Users
# Users listed here will be invited and given PL100 when the bot creates a new Administration room

# Deactivated user PFP
# This is the profile image (in mxc:// format) that will be set to user profiles before deactivation. if left blank it will simply be removed
# Recommended is blank or `mxc://matrix.org/LaVsSRIBaLkOwvehbwDxEDio`

# Deactivated user DisplayName
# Display name to set to any deactivated user. Unsure what will happen if left blank.

# Location of dendrite.yaml
# the interface steals database information from the dendrite.yaml configuration file to work
