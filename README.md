# dendrite-admin-interface
A bot interface for administrating a Dendrite server using the administration api and some database interfacing

This codebase has not begun and is not intended to be contributed to yet. 

The goal of this repo at this time is to collect feature requests in the issues.

Feel free to make a issue for each requested feature so when I finally get time I have a list to go through and check off.
